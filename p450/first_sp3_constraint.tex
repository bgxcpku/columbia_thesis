\caption{The constraints applied to sp\superscript{3} atoms during the constrained minimization and first minimization Monte Carlo sampling stage.
The spring constant of the bond constraint (red arrow) is 100 kcal/mol/angstrom\superscript{2}, and that of the angle constraint is 25 kcal/mol/degree\superscript{2}.
The oxygen atom depicted in this figure is a ``dummy'' atom and does not interact with any other atoms in the structure except through the constraint.}
