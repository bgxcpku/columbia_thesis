Prediction of sites of metabolism is a three stage procedure:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Initially a number of different ligand conformations are generated, and these are docked into a rigid protein, with soft VDW terms using Glide \cite{halgren2004glide,friesner2004glide}.
\item The docked conformations are refined using a Monte Carlo Minimization (MMC) approach which samples degrees of freedom in both the ligand and protein.
\item Refined conformations are classified into reactive site or non-reactive site on the basis of the energy of the refined conformations and the intrinsic reactivity of the site. \cite{li2011idsite}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Monte Carlo Minimization Refinement}
\label{subsection:p450/mcm}
Since the emphasis in IDSite sampling is efficient sampling of low energy conformations, as only the lowest energy conformations are passed on to the next stage of prediction, Monte Carlo Minimization, which provides more efficient sampling of low energy conformations, was used instead of a more traditional Monte Carlo simulation (see \ref{subsection:monte_carlo}).
The Monte Carlo Minimization sampling used by IDSite for refinement incorporates three different types of steps: side chain motions, rigid body transformations, and hybrid Monte Carlo simulations.
For each Monte Carlo step one of three types of motions is selected according to the weighted probabilities, which are different for the two different PLOP sampling stages, see Table \ref{table:mmc_params}.
\input{tables/mmc_params}
Using the chosen method a new conformation is proposed and minimized before the Metropolis acceptance criteria (equation \ref{equation:metropolis_acceptance}) is applied to the proposed state, using a temperature of 300 K.
All atoms of all residues with any atom within 5 Angstroms of the ligand in the starting crystal structure were allowed to move during Monte Carlo moves, including the ligand itself.

During the minimization Monte Carlo sampling stages of the IDSite procedure artificial constraints are used to guide the sampling towards a transition state like conformation.
These constraints create artificial bond or angle potentials which affect the minimization, but are not used in the Monte Carlo acceptance test.
For each of the minimization Monte Carlo sampling stages of the IDSite procedure two different sets of constraints are applied depending on the hybridization of the carbon atom at the possible site of metabolism, for a total of four possible different sets of constraints.
In the first minimization Monte Carlo stage two constraints are applied:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The sulfur-iron-carbon angle is constrained to 145 degrees, with 20 degrees of ``slack'', or a flat bottom to the potential well (denoted as 145\plusorminus20 degrees).
The spring constant of this constraint is about 25 kcal/mol/degree\superscript{2}, or {\textapprox}40\% the strength of a carbon-carbon-carbon angle.
\item A ``dummy'' oxygen atom is placed above the plane of the heme group, in the same position that it would occupy if an oxygen molecule was bound to the heme.  
This dummy atom has no interactions with other atoms, but is used as the anchor of a distance constraint for the carbon at the site of metabolism.  
The carbon-dummy oxygen distance is constrained to 2.5\plusorminus0.5 angstroms.
The spring constant of this constraint is 100 kcal/mol/angstrom\superscript{2}, approximately 1/3rd the strength of a carbon-carbon bond.
\end{enumerate}

In the second minimization Monte Carlo sampling stage the constraints are different for sp\superscript{2} and sp\superscript{3} carbons.
For sp\superscript{3} sites:
\begin{enumerate}
\item the hydrogen bound to the carbon at the possible site of metabolism is constrained to a distance of 1.25\plusorminus0.1 angstroms and a spring constant of 20 kcal/mol/angstrom\superscript{2},
\item the carbon in question is constrained to 2.2\plusorminus0.8 angstroms and a spring constant of 10 kcal/mol/angstrom\superscript{2},
\item the heme iron-hydrogen-carbon angle is constrained to 138\plusorminus5 degrees and a spring constant of 20 kcal/mol/degree\superscript{2}.
\end{enumerate}
For sp\superscript{2} sites:
\begin{enumerate}
\item the carbon at the possible site of metabolism is constrained to 1.8\plusorminus0.1 angstroms and a spring constant of 20 kcal/mol/angstrom\superscript{2},
\item both adjacent carbons are also constrained to the dummy oxygen atom, at a distance of 2.5\plusorminus0.1 angstroms and a spring constant of 20 kcal/mol/angstrom\superscript{2}, and
\item finally the hydrogen bonded to the carbon at the possible site of metabolism is constrained to the oxygen atom at a distance of 2.0\plusorminus0.1 angstroms and a 20 kcal/mol/angstrom\superscript{2} spring constant.
\end{enumerate}

As CYP2D6 forms a conserved salt bridge with the substrate with either glutamate 216 and aspartate 301 \cite{paine2003residues}, this was also incorporated as a constraint during the sampling stages.
In the first sampling stage this salt bridge is enforced by introducing a harmonic constraint of 3.0\plusorminus0.3 angstroms, between the basic nitrogen of the substrate and each of the side chain oxygen atoms in GLU216, ASP301 and SER304.
The spring constants of this constraints are 15.0, 8.0 and 4.0 kcal/mol/angstrom\superscript{2} for GLU216, ASP301 and SER304 respectively.
Additionally, an angle constraint is applied to each of the N-H-O angles, this is set to 150.0\plusorminus30.0 degrees and has a spring constant of 5.0 kcal/mol/degree\superscript{2}.
\input{p450/salt_bridge_first} % figure
In the second sampling stage four separate trajectories are calculated for each of the four carboxalate oxygens of GLU216, ASP301.
In each trajectory a constraint of 1.9\plusorminus0.1 angstroms is applied between the hydrogen attached to the basic substrate nitrogen and one of the four carboxalate oxygens.
Additionally, the angle of the hydrogen bond is constrained to 168\plusorminus12 degrees, with a spring constant of 5.0 kcal/mol/degree\superscript{2}.
