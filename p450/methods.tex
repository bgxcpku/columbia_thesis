Prediction of sites of metabolism is a three stage procedure:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Initially a number of different ligand conformations are generated, and these are docked into a rigid protein, with soft VDW terms using Glide \cite{halgren2004glide,friesner2004glide}.
\item The docked conformations are refined using a Monte Carlo Minimization (MMC) approach which samples degrees of freedom in both the ligand and protein.
\item Refined conformations are classified into reactive site or non-reactive site on the basis of the energy of the refined conformations and the intrinsic reactivity of the site. \cite{li2011idsite}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Monte Carlo Minimization Refinement}
\label{subsection:p450/mcm}
The refinement procedure used by IDSITE, makes use of a Monte Carlo Minimization procedure.
Since an emphasis was placed on efficient sampling of low energy conformations, as only these conformations are passed on to the next stage of prediction, Monte Carlo Minimization which provides more efficient sampling of low energy conformations was used instead of a more traditional Monte Carlo simulation (see \ref{subsection:monte_carlo}).
This IDSITE Monte Carlo Minimization refinement procedure incorportates three different types of steps: side chain motions, rigid body transformations, and hybrid Monte Carlo simulations.
For each Monte Carlo step one of these three types of motions is selected according to the weighted probabilities 14:7:1 (side-chain:rigid-body:hybrid-Monte-Carlo).
A new conformation is proposed according to the chosen move type.
This conformation is minimized before the Metropolis acceptance criteria (equation \ref{equation:metropolis_acceptance}) is applied to the proposed state, using a temperature of 300 K.
All atoms of all residues with any atom within 5 Angstroms of the ligand in the starting crystal structure were allowed to move during Monte Carlo moves, including the ligand itself.

%For the simulations described in this paper, we used the following parameters: Short range energy dipole-dipole and Lennard-Jones cutoffs of 8 Angstroms were used, as well as 12 Angstrom cutoffs for the short range charge-dipole cutoff and 15 Angstroms for the short range dipole-dipole cutoff.
%All long range cutoffs were set to be effectively infinite.
%In this study, we compared four different functional forms of the potential function.
%In all cases, OPLS-2005 protein parameters were used for both the protein and ligand, as implemented in PLOP.
%Ligand parameters were generated with the hetgrp\_ffgen utility of Schrodinger software, using OPLS-2005 parameters.
%Surface Generalized Born implicit solvent was used, in the form described in \cite{ghosh1998generalized}.
%In previous papers using structure prediction with PLOP, two separate correction terms were introduced which substantially improved side chain prediction.
%One was a hydrophobic attraction term, introduced by analogy with the ChemScore [cite].
%The second was a variable dielectric treatment of charged side chains, accounting for the change of polarization around charged moieties \cite{zhu2007improved}. % also variable dielectric in generalized born sigalov2005incorporating
%Our four effective potential energy functions are four choices resulting from inclusion or exclusion of these correction terms.
%For each combination of force fields and for each structure, a sequence of 3100 repetitions of the overall serial MC sequence was carried out.
%The relative probabilities for HMC, rigid body MC, and side chain MC were 1, 7, and 14, respectively (the total probability is normalized to 1.0).
%Minimized Monte Carlo acceptance was performed at 300 K.
%[We can decide how much of our intermediate results about useful parameters to use here.
%I'd lean towards more mentions.
%It would help explain some of the screwy combinations we have (like the different MC acceptance criteria)].
