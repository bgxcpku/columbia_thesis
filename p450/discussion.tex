\section{Discussion}
\label{section:p450/discussion}
The physical score performs nearly as well as the fitted score indicating that the model is not overfit to the training set.
Figure \ref{figure:idsite_other} presents a comparison of both IDSite models (physical and fit) to a number of other methods for prediction of P450 sites of metabolism.
Though the data sets used are not identical they are similar and overlapping for some compounds.
At all sensitivities IDSite is clearly the best performing protocol, with the physical and fit model performing very nearly identically.

At 90\% sensitivity, the QSAR method included roughly 20\% false positives, and MetaSite included 40\% false positives.
At the same sensitivity IDSite has a \textapprox1\% false positives rate.
This represents a significant improvement in prediction accuracy that has the potential to have a large impact on drug development.

\subsection{Significance of Sampling Stages}
\label{subsection:p450/discussion/sampling_stages}
\input{p450/roc_sampling}
As shown in Figure \ref{figure:idsite_roc_sampling} at a given specificity, sensitivity increases with additional sampling.
For some compounds there are either no conformations predicted via the docking procedure where the site of metabolism is sufficiently close to the heme oxygen to react or the scoring metric used by the docking procedure prefers conformations which are far from the reactive site over more reactive conformations.
The sampling stages, and constraints are useful in guiding these initial docked poses into more active conformations.

The trajectory followed duing the minimization Monte Carlo sampling stages differs appreciably for small and large ligands.
For smaller ligands, in many cases the poses after the first constrained minimization were among the lowest energy poses explored.
For about 40\% of these small ligands (24/56) the same predictions were obtained after the first minimization Monte Carlo sampling stage as after the full IDSite procedure.
However, for large ligands, the constraings and sampling continued to decrease the energy over the course of the sampling stages, indicating that especially for large compounds the second refinement stage is critical to obtaining accurate predictions.
