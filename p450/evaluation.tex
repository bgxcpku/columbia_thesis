Both a parameterized and an unparameterized model were used to classify potential sites of metabolism.
IDSITE makes the assumptions that all intermediates before the rate determining step are at equilibrium \cite{wang2007stochastic}, that hydrogen abstraction is the rate limiting step for hydroxilation of aliphatic carbons and electrophilic attack is the rate limiting step for hydroxilation of aromatic rings \cite{guengerich2001common,shaik2005theoretical}.
With these assumptions the rate of metabolism at each possible site of reaction is affected by the free energy of binding in order to put that site in the site of reaction, as well as the free energy barrier of rate determining step, or
\input{equations/curtin_hammett}

The ${\Delta}G_{\mathrm{binding}}$ above is calculated using a PLOP evaluation of the refined pose.
${\Delta}G_{\mathrm{barrier}}$ is computed using a simplified heme-ligand system using DFT quantum mechanics.
Since the ligand is forced to assume a different conformation in order to react, the energy of this transition state conformation is also computed using PLOP.


As the relative abundance of different metabolites is determined by differences in ${\Delta}G$ per site rather than absolute reactivities
