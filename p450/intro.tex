\section{Introduction}
\label{section:p450/introduction}
The most common method of drug clearance among currently perscribed drugs is metabolism, which is the primary method of clearance for approximately 75\% of the top 200 most commonly perscribed drugs in the United States \cite{williams2004drug}.
Cytochrome p450 is critical to drug metabolism, being active in approximately 75\% of drugs which are cleared in this method \cite{guengerich2007cytochrome}.
