\chapter[Monte Carlo Minimization in SOM Prediction]{Application of Monte Carlo Minimization Sampling to Prediction of P450 Sites of Metabolism}
\label{chapter:p450}
\textit{ Parts of this chapter are adapted from ``IDSite: An Accurate Approach to Predict P450-Mediated Drug Metabolism''  [Li, J.; Schneebeli, S.; \textbf{Bylund, J.}; Farid, R.; Friesner, R.; 2011].
My contribution to the paper was principally in the minimization Monte Carlo method described and the small molecule library used for the ligands.}
