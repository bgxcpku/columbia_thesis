Rotamer assembly or systematic search shares some similarity with fragment buildup techniques in that it uses a rotamer library to assemble possible loops.
This rotamer library represents the common backbone dihedrals for each amino acid.
This method operates by dividing the loop into two pieces, usually in half, and considering all possible half loops which can be built using rotamer library.
