Metropolis Monte-Carlo simulation was originally developed in the 1950's to provide rapid sampling of the solution space of many variable problems \cite{metropolis1953equation}.
\cite{hastings1970monte}
It is a commonly used method in statistical physics, statistics, sequence and structural biology.

Monte-Carlo minimization  \cite{li1987monte}.
Umbrella sampling\cite{torrie1977nonphysical}.
