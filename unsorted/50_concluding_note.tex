\section{Conclusion}
\label{section:unsorted/conclusion}

Maintaining the current rate of progress in drug development is a challenging problem.
This is despite advancements in the rate at which new structures are being determined.
Computer assisted drug development has the potential to help maintain this progress by helping focus research on more likely drug molecules and allowing efficient screening of large libraries of small molecules. 

This thesis has focused on development in the Protein Local Optimization Program, which has in the past been used as a tool to predict side chain and loop conformations.
We have focused on adding additional support for small molecules and mutation scanning.
Additional progress has been made in a number of supporting tools which have greatly helped development in a number of areas.
