A strong correlation between observed and expected \ddg\ was not found for any of the structures nor for the set of mutations taken as a whole.
Despite this single side chain conformations were in very good agreement between predicted sidechain locations and crystal structures, suggesting that sufficient sampling was done in the side chain prediction step.
