A strong correlation between observed and expected \ddg\ was not found for any of the structures nor for the set of mutations taken as a whole.
Despite this single side chain conformations were in very good agreement between predicted side chain locations and crystal structures, suggesting that sufficient sampling was done in the side chain prediction step.

\subsection{Barstar-Barnase Complex (Barnase Mutated)}
The first complex examined is the Barstar-Barnase complex.
This complex is frequently used as a case study in protein-protein interaction, as the complex exhibits one of the highest known binding affinities, K\subscript{d} = 0.01 pM \cite{hartley1988barnase,hartley1989barnase,schreiber1993interaction}.
Experimental affinity data is available from alanine scanning mutations for eight residues in barnase and six residues for barstar.
Mutations to each chain were considered independently, and mutations to barstar are covered in the following section.
The correlation between predicted and experimental \ddg\ binding was not significant, see figure \ref{figure:computational_mutation_scanning/1BRSa_ddg}, $R^{2}=0.08$.

%The agreement between predicted and experimental conformations for this complex is illustrated for a number of side chains in figures  and \ref{figure:computational_mutation_scanning/1brs_a_73}.

    \label{figure:computational_mutation_scanning/1BRSa_ddg}
\end{figure}

Table \ref{table:1BRSa_results} shows the computed and experimental \ddg's used to generate figure \ref{figure:computational_mutation_scanning/1BRSa_ddg}.
\input{tables/1brs_a.tex}
Table \ref{table:1BRSa_rmsd} shows the root mean square distance for the side chain conformations predicted during the mutation scan to the crystal structure.
All eight side chains are predicted within 1.3 angstroms of the native structure, and the median prediction is 0.359 angstroms, which is a very accurate prediction and generally sufficiently accurate to reproduce native binding interactions.
\input{tables/1BRSa_rmsd.tex}

Despite the lack of correlation of predicted binding affinities with experimental values, single single side chain conformations predicted in the course of the mutation scan were in very good agreement with crystal structures.
This indicates that sufficient sampling was done in the side chain prediction step of the computation.
Figure \ref{figure:computational_mutation_scanning/1brs_a_58} shows the predicted and crystal conformations for Asp 58 of barnase.
The conformations are almost identical, differing by only 0.121 angstroms, or less than the resolution of the crystal structure (2.0 angstroms).

\end{figure}

Figure \ref{figure:computational_mutation_scanning/1brs_a_73} shows a similar comparison for glutamic acid 73, which was one of the least successful predictions in this complex.
However, it would still be classified as a successful side chain prediction for many purposes, differing from the crystal structure by 0.993 angstroms.

\subsection{Barstar-Barnase Complex (Barstar Mutated)}
The second example makes use of the same complex, but it is the other partner of the complex, barstar, which is mutated.
The results here are similar to the previous case, in which figure \ref{figure:computational_mutation_scanning/1BRSd_ddg} shows that there is little correlation between computed and experimental \ddg, $R^{2}=0.21$.

\begin{figure}[h]

    \label{figure:computational_mutation_scanning/1BRSd_ddg}
\end{figure}

Table \ref{table:1BRSd_results} shows the predicted and experimental \ddg\ binding for the barstar-barnase complex, depicted in figure \ref{figure:computational_mutation_scanning/1BRSd_ddg}.
\input{tables/1brs_d.tex}
Table \ref{table:1BRSd_rmsd} shows the agreement of sampled side chain conformations with the native conformations.
Five of six side chains are predicted within 0.4 angstroms of their native conformation, maintaining all native contacts, and supporting the ability of the sampling method to explore sufficiently native-like conformations that the energy model is able to differentiate native-like from non-native like conformations.
\input{tables/1BRSd_rmsd.tex}
Figure \ref{figure:computational_mutation_scanning/1brs_all}  illustrates this in general for the protein-protein interface.

Five of the six residues are less than 0.4 angstroms RMSD to the crystal structure.
The only exception is glutamic acid 80, shown in the upper left of this figure, and also figure \protect\ref{figure:computational_mutation_scanning/1brs_d_80}.}
\label{figure:computational_mutation_scanning/1brs_all}
\end{figure}

An example successful prediction is illustrated in \ref{figure:computational_mutation_scanning/1brs_d_35}.
\begin{figure}[h]

    The distance to the crystal structure is only 0.098 angstroms, or nearly identical.}
    \label{figure:computational_mutation_scanning/1brs_d_35}
\end{figure}

The prediction which differs by the greatest amount from the crystal structure, Glu 80, is illustrated in \ref{figure:computational_mutation_scanning/1brs_d_80}.
While this predictions differs from the native by \textapprox 1.8 angstroms, this is still on the border of what is frequently considered a successful side chain prediction.
However, a prediction which differs from the native by this amount makes successfully predicting binding affinity difficult as the predicted conformation does not accurately recapitulate the contacts formed in the native complex.
\begin{figure}[h]

    The difference between these two conformations is 1.804 angstroms, which while sometimes considered a ``successful'' prediction, is not sufficiently close to generate the same interactions, making it difficult to accurately predict binding affinities.}

The third example is an an antibody, anti-antibody complex.
The structure taken from PDBid 1DVF is of anti-hen-egg-white lysozyme antibody complexed with an antibody mimicking the hen egg white lysozyme \cite{braden1996crystal}.

PDBid 1FCC depicts a fragment from streptococcal protein G in complex with an IgG antibody.
