All three of these side chains are in good agreement with the crystal structure, with side chain RMSD's of 0.403, 0.594 and 0.371 respectively.

Tryptophan 43 is interesting in that despite being critical to protein-protein binding it is largely buried in a pocket defined by the neighboring protein structure.
