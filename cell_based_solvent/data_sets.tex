% energy calculations data set
The data set used for energy calculation experiments consisted of large protein structures, containing neither DNA, RNA, or modified residues with molecular masses between 100 and 150 kDa. 
All samples had resolutions better than 2 angstroms. 
The data set was filtered at 30\% sequence identity, and from this, 20 structures were selected at random, though two were later excluded due to technical reasons.
% Larger structures were used to better illustrate the performance improvement using this method.

% side chain prediction data set
The structures used in side chain prediction experiments consisted of high resolution enzyme structures.
Structures without an enzyme classification were excluded, as were structures with X-ray resolution less than 1.5 angstroms, or those with modified protein residues.
This resolution requirement was imposed to make high resolution side chain prediction comparisons more meaningful.
All structures had a molecular mass between 11 kDa and 110 kDa.
Structures containing DNA, RNA or modified side chain residues were excluded, as were those that had unreasonable steric clashes either within the canonical structure or with crystal neighbors.
Structures containing certain small molecules without energy parameterizations currently defined within PLOP were also excluded.
