% side chain prediction experiments
For side chain prediction, the specific side chains used were those which had at least 30\% solvent accessible surface area when evaluated in the absence of other chains or crystal neighbors.
Glycine and proline residues were also excluded, as they do not have free side chains.
Residues missing heavy atoms in the crystal structure were predicted; however, RMSD was not measured for these residues because there is no experimental data.
Side chain prediction experiments were performed as described in \cite{jacobson2002role}.

% energy calculations experiments
The experiment in this case consisted of multiple energy calculations, using the modified version of the OPLS-AA force field described in Li {\it et. al.} 2011 \cite{li2011vsgb}.
In the control experiments, the same method for evaluating the implicit solvent term was used as in previous works.
