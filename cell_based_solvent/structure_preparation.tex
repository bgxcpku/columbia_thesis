In preparing the crystal structures for energy calculation and side chain prediction experiments, the first step was to add the crystal copies of the protein of interest.
PLOP completes this step for all space groups according to the crystal symmetry identified in the PDB file.
Before modeling a structure using an all atom force field, it is also necessary to add hydrogens and any missing heavy atoms.
When possible, PLOP uses the positions of bonded heavy atoms to build missing atoms into the structure.
However, adding hydrogens, especially for titratable residues, is a more complicated problem.
To address this, PLOP uses the independent cluster decomposition algorithm (ICDA) to determine the protonation states of any titratable residues, as well as the positions of polar hydrogens \cite{li2007assignment}.
Generally speaking, this proceeds by dividing titratable and polar residues into independent groups using a distance cutoff, and optimizing each group independently.
Structures with unreasonable steric clashes with crystal neighbors were removed from the data set on the basis that such structures are physically unlikely.
