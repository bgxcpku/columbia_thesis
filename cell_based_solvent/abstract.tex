% You need one or two sentences here to introduce the topic more broadly - drug design, modeling protein interactions, etc. - then say what you've done (as below).
We present an application of grid-based spatial indexing, a computer graphics algorithm optimized for fast geometric lookup and collision detection, to evaluate the solvation term of the surface area based generalized Born (S-GB) implicit solvent model.
This method is mathematically equivalent to the naive implementation and reduces the time complexity of the limiting step in energy calculations.
% Of practical importance, we show that significant time can be saved by using this algorithm.
Performance comparisons using an implementation in the Protein Local Optimization Program (PLOP) are presented both for a small set of energy calculations and simultaneous side chain prediction of solvent accessible side chains in 155 high resolution crystal structures, 11030 side chain predictions in total.
Identical results are obtained for energy calculations, and we show that slight differences in side chain predictions do not introduce a systematic bias.
